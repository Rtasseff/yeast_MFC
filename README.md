yeast\_MFC
=================
A Biocellion multiscale model of budding yeast in a micro fluidic chip.
Simulates a multiscale model of agent based cells in a PDE environment.


Gen Info
---------
Created - RAT 20130927
Latest release of biocellion framework at 20131230.
In concert with Dr Charvin at IGBMC
Not for public use

Notes
--------
See the folder dev\_notes\_tex for the development notes.
This includes information about the model and the code.
The notes are being recorded as the model is being developed,
so they are not complete, and are not meant to be the sole source of information.
Instead the notes are meant to facilitate understanding for familiar users and 
to document model aspects for developers.

The notes can be compiled using standard latex packages.
The primary tex file is dev\_notes.tex and it requires the folder figs.
Bibtex was used for referencing and must be run with latex compilation,
this requires the bitex database recorded in mainRefDB.bib.

Code
------
The code is available in the folder model.
This is only the model specific code as described by the Biocellion API.
We will not discuss the API in this project, 
instead users must obtain information from the Biocellion Project directly.
