	cell cycle transcription programme in a number of model organisms.
	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae data in particular have been subjected
	to a wide range of bioinformatics analysis methods, aimed at identifying
	the correct and complete set of periodically expressed genes. RESULTS:
	Here, we provide the first thorough benchmark of such methods, surprisingly
	revealing that most new and more mathematically advanced methods
	actually perform worse than the analysis published with the original
	microarray data sets. We show that this loss of accuracy specifically
	affects methods that only model the shape of the expression profile
	without taking into account the magnitude of regulation. We present
	a simple permutation-based method that performs better than most
	existing methods.},

	time-course gene expression data.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {233},
  abstract = {In practice many biological time series measurements, including gene
	microarrays, are conducted at time points that seem to be interesting
	in the biologist's opinion and not necessarily at fixed time intervals.
	In many circumstances we are interested in finding targets that are
	expressed periodically. To tackle the problems of uneven sampling
	and unknown type of noise in periodicity detection, we propose to
	use robust regression.The aim of this paper is to develop a general
	framework for robust periodicity detection and review and rank different
	approaches by means of simulations. We also show the results for
	some real measurement data.The simulation results clearly show that
	when the sampling of time series gets more and more uneven, the methods
	that assume even sampling become unusable. We find that M-estimation
	provides a good compromise between robustness and computational efficiency.Since
	uneven sampling occurs often in biological measurements, the robust
	methods developed in this paper are expected to have many uses. The
	regression based formulation of the periodicity detection problem
	easily adapts to non-uniform sampling. Using robust regression helps
	to reject inconsistently behaving data points.The implementations
	are currently available for Matlab and will be made available for
	the users of R as well. More information can be found in the web-supplement

	proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate.
	This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
	true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control
	of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
	there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type
	procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent
	test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power

  abstract = {Phase-locking (frequency entrainment) of an oscillator, in which a
	periodic extrinsic signal drives oscillations at a frequency different
	from the unperturbed frequency, is a useful property for study of
	oscillator stability and structure. The cell cycle is frequently
	described as a biochemical oscillator; however, because this oscillator
	is tied to key biological events such as DNA replication and segregation,
	and to cell growth (cell mass increase), it is unclear whether phase
	locking is possible for the cell cycle oscillator. We found that
	forced periodic expression of the G(1) cyclin CLN2 phase locks the
	cell cycle of budding yeast over a range of extrinsic periods in
	an exponentially growing monolayer culture. We characterize the behavior
	of cells in a pedigree using a return map to determine the efficiency
	of entrainment to the externally controlled pulse. We quantify differences
	between mothers and daughters and how synchronization of an expanding
	population differs from synchronization of a single oscillator. Mothers
	only lock intermittently whereas daughters lock completely and in
	a different period range than mothers. We can explain quantitative
	features of phase locking in both cell types with an analytically
	solvable model based on cell size control and how mass is partitioned
	between mother and daughter cells. A key prediction of this model
	is that size control can occur not only in G(1), but also later in
	the cell cycle under the appropriate conditions; this prediction
	is confirmed in our experimental data. Our results provide quantitative
	insight into how cell size is integrated with the cell cycle oscillator.},

	in using gene expression microarray data for class prediction, for
	example to detect disease, identify tumors or predict treatment response.
	Accurate statistical inference from such data is difficult due to
	the small number of observations, typically tens, relative to the
	large number of genes, typically thousands. Moreover, conventional
	methods from machine learning lead to decisions which are usually
	very difficult to interpret in simple or biologically meaningful
	terms. In contrast, the TSP classifier provides decision rules which
	i) involve very few genes and only relative expression values (e.g.,
	comparing the mRNA counts within a single pair of genes); ii) are
	both accurate and transparent; and iii) provide specific hypotheses

  abstract = {This study presents a novel approach to detect biological associations
	for gene pairs with cell cycle-specific expression profiles. Previous
	studies have shown that periodic transcription is commonly regulated
	by transcription factors that are also periodically transcribed,
	and there is a growing number of examples where cell cycle regulated
	genes are conserved in yeast and mammalian cells. Some genes have
	periodicity for their oscillatory activity throughout cell division.
	These cell cycle-specific oscillatory activities could be explained
	by a biological phenomenon in terms of efficiency and logical order.
	In the yeast data used in this study, about 13\% of genes behave
	in this manner based on a previous yeast study. Microarrays have
	been applied to determine genome-wide expression patterns during
	the cell cycle of a number of different cells. Moreover, several
	previous studies have shown that many pairs of genes, which have
	linearly correlated expression profiles, have similar cellular roles
	or physical interactions. Based on this point of view, the traditional
	clustering methods have focused on similar expression profiles based
	on the premise that genes with similar expression profiles have similar
	biological functions or relevant biological interactions. However,
	there are a number of previous studies indicating that the expression
	of some genes may be delayed compared to others due to a time lag
	in their transcriptional control. Therefore, we propose a novel clustering
	method, named as phase-synchronization clustering, based on the theory
	of phase synchronization for detecting biological associations using
	cell cycle-specific expression profiles. We evaluate phase-synchronization
	clustering here using Saccharomyces cerevisiae microarray data. Phase-synchronization
	clustering is able to detect biologically associated gene pairs that
	have linearly correlated (simultaneous and inverted) as well as time-delayed
	expression profiles. The performance of phase-synchronization clustering
	is compared with other conventional clustering methods. The likelihood
	of finding relevant biological associations by phase-synchronization
	clustering is significantly higher than other clustering methods.
	Therefore, phase-synchronization clustering is more efficient for
	detecting known biological interactions for gene pairs than other
	conventional clustering methods for analyzing cell cycle-specific
	expression data. The evaluation analysis of the results by phase-synchronization
	clustering also suggests that the cellular activities during the
	cell division process could be understood as a phenomenon of collective
	synchronization.},

  abstract = {An important problem in molecular biology is to build a complete understanding
	of transcriptional regulatory processes in the cell. We have developed
	a flexible, probabilistic framework to predict TF binding from multiple
	data sources that differs from the standard hypothesis testing (scanning)
	methods in several ways. Our probabilistic modeling framework estimates
	the probability of binding and, thus, naturally reflects our degree
	of belief in binding. Probabilistic modeling also allows for easy
	and systematic integration of our binding predictions into other
	probabilistic modeling methods, such as expression-based gene network
	inference. The method answers the question of whether the whole analyzed
	promoter has a binding site, but can also be extended to estimate
	the binding probability at each nucleotide position. Further, we
	introduce an extension to model combinatorial regulation by several
	TFs. Most importantly, the proposed methods can make principled probabilistic
	inference from multiple evidence sources, such as, multiple statistical
	models (motifs) of the TFs, evolutionary conservation, regulatory
	potential, CpG islands, nucleosome positioning, DNase hypersensitive
	sites, ChIP-chip binding segments and other (prior) sequence-based
	biological knowledge. We developed both a likelihood and a Bayesian
	method, where the latter is implemented with a Markov chain Monte
	Carlo algorithm. Results on a carefully constructed test set from
	the mouse genome demonstrate that principled data fusion can significantly
	improve the performance of TF binding prediction methods. We also

	the mouse genome and the results indicate a sparse connectivity between

	with the surrounding or infiltrating cell types. This heterogeneity
	in the sample preparation hinders further statistical analysis, significantly
	so if different samples contain different proportions of these cell
	types. Thus, sample heterogeneity can result in the identification
	of differentially expressed genes that may be unrelated to the biological
	question being studied. Similarly, irrelevant gene combinations can
	be discovered in the case of gene expression based classification.We
	propose a computational framework for removing the effects of sample
	heterogeneity by "microdissecting" microarray data in silico. The
	computational method provides estimates of the expression values
	of the pure (non-heterogeneous) cell samples. The inversion of the
	sample heterogeneity can be facilitated by providing accurate estimates
	of the mixing percentages of different cell types in each measurement.
	For those cases where no such information is available, we develop
	an optimization-based method for joint estimation of the mixing percentages
	and the expression values of the pure cell samples. We also consider
	the problem of selecting the correct number of cell types.The efficiency
	of the proposed methods is illustrated by applying them to a carefully
	controlled cDNA microarray data obtained from heterogeneous samples.
	The results demonstrate that the methods are capable of reconstructing
	both the sample and cell type specific expression values from heterogeneous
	mixtures and that the mixing percentages of different cell types
	can also be estimated. Furthermore, a general purpose model selection
	method can be used to select the correct number of cell types.},

	Recent studies have suggested that components of the circadian pacemaker,

	of processes, including obesity, sensitization to cocaine, cancer
	susceptibility, and morbidity to chemotherapeutic agents. To identify
	a more complete cohort of genes that are transcriptionally regulated

	transcription factors that were rhythmic in either muscle or liver,

	is regulated in part by a transcriptional cascade. In comparing tissues
	from WT and Clock mutant mice, we found that the Clock mutation affects
	the expression of many genes that are rhythmic in WT tissue, but
	also profoundly affects many nonrhythmic genes. In both liver and
	skeletal muscle, a significant number of CLOCK-regulated genes were
	associated with the cell cycle and cell proliferation. To determine

	Genomic analyses of the localization and expression dynamics of transcription
	factors suggest that a network of sequentially expressed transcription
	factors could control the temporal programme of transcription during
	the cell cycle. However, directed studies interrogating small numbers
	of genes indicate that their periodic transcription is governed by
	the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). To determine the
	extent to which the global cell-cycle transcription programme is
	controlled by cyclin-CDK complexes, we examined genome-wide transcription
	dynamics in budding yeast mutant cells that do not express S-phase
	and mitotic cyclins. Here we show that a significant fraction of
	periodic genes are aberrantly expressed in the cyclin mutant. Although
	cells lacking cyclins are blocked at the G1/S border, nearly 70\%
	of periodic genes continued to be expressed periodically and on schedule.
	Our findings reveal that although CDKs have a function in the regulation
	of cell-cycle transcription, they are not solely responsible for
	establishing the global periodic transcription programme. We propose
	that periodic transcription is an emergent property of a transcription
	factor network that can function as a cell-cycle oscillator independently
	of, and in tandem with, the CDK oscillator.},

	in adult skin are initiated when specialized mesenchymal dermal papilla
	(DP) cells send cues to multipotent epithelial stem cells. Subsequently,
	DP cells are enveloped by epithelial stem cell progeny and other
	cell types to form a niche orchestrating hair growth. Understanding
	the general biological principles that govern the mesenchymal-epithelial
	interactions within the DP niche, however, has been hampered so far
	by the lack of systematic approaches to dissect the complete molecular
	make-up of this complex tissue. Here, we take a novel multicolor
	labeling approach, using cell type-specific transgenic expression
	of red and green fluorescent proteins in combination with immunolabeling
	of specific antigens, to isolate pure populations of DP and four
	of its surrounding cell types: dermal fibroblasts, melanocytes, and
	two different populations of epithelial progenitors (matrix and outer
	root sheath cells). By defining their transcriptional profiles, we
	develop molecular signatures characteristic for the DP and its niche.
	Validating the functional importance of these signatures is a group
	of genes linked to hair disorders that have been largely unexplored.
	Additionally, the DP signature reveals novel signaling and transcription
	regulators that distinguish them from other cell types. The mesenchymal-epithelial
	signatures include key factors previously implicated in ectodermal-neural
	fate determination, as well as a myriad of regulators of bone morphogenetic
	protein signaling. These findings establish a foundation for future
	functional analyses of the roles of these genes in hair development.
	Overall, our strategy illustrates how knowledge of the genes uniquely
	expressed by each cell type residing in a complex niche can reveal
	important new insights into the biology of the tissue and its associated

	We then proposed a novel feature selection approach using MI in a

	be explained by different empirical distributions of the data. In
	contrast to ANOVA and KW, MI detects shifts in location when the

	ANOVA but not MI is often significant if one genotype with a small
	frequency had a remarkable difference in the average gene expression

	estimate for the within-class covariance matrix is singular, and
	so the usual discriminant rule cannot be applied. Second, when p
	is large, it is difficult to interpret the classification rule obtained
	from LDA, since it involves all p features. We propose penalized

	The discriminant problem is not convex, so we use a minorization-maximization
	approach in order to efficiently optimize it when convex penalties

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing
	(ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling array analysis (ChIP-chip)
	have become standard technologies for genome-wide identification
	of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number of algorithms have
	been developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites
	from ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization
	in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser
	as custom annotation tracks. However, summarizing these tracks can
	be a daunting task, particularly if there are a large number of binding
	sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across the genome.We
	have developed ChIPpeakAnno as a Bioconductor package within the
	statistical programming environment R to facilitate batch annotation
	of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, cap analysis
	of gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments resulting in a large
	number of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites annotated with
	ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or plotted
	in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest
	genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities
	for determining the significance of overlap between replicates or
	binding sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for
	drawing Venn diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between
	replicates. Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to
	retrieve sequences flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification,
	cloning, or motif discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms
	associated with adjacent genes.ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation
	of the binding sites identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or
	any technology that results in a large number of enriched genomic
	regions within the statistical programming environment R. Allowing
	users to pass their own annotation data such as a different Chromatin
	immunoprecipitation (ChIP) preparation and a dataset from literature,
	or existing annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and BSgenome,
	provides flexibility. Tight integration to the biomaRt package enables
	up-to-date annotation retrieval from the BioMart database.},
